		<h1>What is a Network?</h1>
		<p></p>
	
	</section>

	<section>
		<p>A network is the connection between devices such as computers, mobile phones, and peripherals. Devices are connected to this ever expansive network through routers, switches, and wireless access points that provide connection points to the internet. The internet is a great big and growing network known as the ‘network of networks’ that is the forum of connecting all networks across the world at a fraction of a second. </p>

	<h2>How Does The Internet Connect to other countries?</h2>
	<p>
		Internet cables are installed all around the world in different ways to connect towns, cities and countries together. It can be placed underground, under the sea, aerial, covered visible cables, and mounting. In most cases they are all used to fit together.
		</p>
		<p>Computers send data or messages to other computers which is broken down into packets containing numbers that instruct how the message should be broken down and sent off to other networks, known as an IP (internet protocol) address. This all happens in a fraction of a second thanks to the internet cables installed all over the world. </p>

			<h1>Extra for experts:</h1>
			<h2>Fibre</h2>
			<p><em><b>What is Fibre?</b></em></p>
			<p>Fibre is a broadband that connects to New Zealand’s internet network structure and provides broadband connections at the fastest speed. It has been used across New Zealand as it is the most reliable broadband connections, can function at great speeds no matter what device capacity. Fibre works by sending pulses of light through the plastic or glass cables at rapid speeds. It is the most up-to-date network of fast broadband.</p>
			<p><em><b>Installation Process</b></em></p>
			<p>The Fibre installation process begins with an external termination point (ETP) that is normally attached to the side of the building. Each building has it’s own cable Connecting the ETP is then determined by where the building’s phone and broadband services. he fibre cable can be added in addition to the copper cable or be installed to replace the copper cable which is used for traditional internet usage. There are a wide range of fibre install partners around New Zealand. This includes North power Fibre, Chorus, Ultra Fast Fibre, and Enable. Each install partner covers different regions of New Zealand. For example, The whole of Wellington and Lower North Island has Chorus installed Fibre, where as Christchurch has Enable. Here are some examples of the fibre network found in Wellington:</p>

				<h3>Aerial</h3>
				<p>Fibre cables can often be found connecting to aerial cables if it is the only method used in the area especially if copper phone and broad band sevices have been used this way.

				<h3>Buried cables</h3>
<p>Buried cables undergo a constuction process where the ground is dug up so the pipes containing fibre can be placed. </p>
